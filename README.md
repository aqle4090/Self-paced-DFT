# Self-paced-FIR


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is self-paced learning of DFT implementation.

     
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Use PYNQ to implement

## Algorithm
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) plays a fundamental role in digital signal processing systems.
It is a method to change a discrete signal in the time domain to the same signal in the frequency
domain.
